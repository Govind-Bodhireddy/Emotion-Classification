# Emotion Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for the project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
2. **jupyternotebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for training and testing models.
3. **models**: Contains pre-trained models.

## Usage

### 1. Data

The data folder contains the dataset used for training and testing the models. Please ensure the dataset is placed in this folder before running the notebooks.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks

The jupyternotebooks folder contains Jupyter notebooks for training and testing different models.

- **Statistical_model.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the training and testing process for a statistical model.
- **Deep_learning_model.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the training and testing process for a deep learning model.

### 3. Pretrained Models

The models folder contains pre-trained models. You can use these models for inference or fine-tuning.
